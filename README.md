Wireless power transmission (WPT) encompasses several modalities, each suited for different applications and ranges. Near-field transmission, often based on inductive or capacitive coupling, is used for short distances—such as charging smartphones or medical implants—where tight alignment and proximity are critical. Far-field transmission employs microwave or radio frequency (RF) waves to send power over longer distances, enabling applications like powering drones or remote sensors. Beaming, a far-field method, uses focused energy—typically via lasers or microwaves—to direct power precisely to a receiver, maximizing efficiency and safety. Plasma-based power transmission, a more experimental domain, involves ionized gas streams (plasmas) to conduct or channel energy across a medium, showing promise for extreme environments or high-energy transfer. Together, these methods highlight the diverse landscape of WPT technologies, each balancing efficiency, safety, and practicality based on use-case needs.

Human levitation, as commonly imagined in science fiction and popular culture, is not currently possible through conventional means due to the constraints of physics. However, certain technologies can create levitation-like effects. Magnetic levitation (maglev) is used in some transportation systems, like trains, and involves using magnetic fields to lift and propel objects. Acoustic levitation employs sound waves to suspend small objects. Electrostatic and aerodynamic levitation are other experimental methods. While these technologies offer intriguing possibilities, they are far from enabling the kind of human levitation seen in fictional contexts.

Using magnetic levitation (maglev) is a feasible method for achieving levitation in a laboratory setting. It works by using magnetic fields to lift and stabilize objects without physical contact, making it a clean and precise technique. In a lab, this could involve superconducting magnets and cryogenic systems to achieve the necessary conditions for stable levitation. While maglev technology is already used in applications like high-speed trains, adapting it for human levitation would require overcoming significant technical challenges, including generating sufficient lift and ensuring safety and stability for the human subject.
